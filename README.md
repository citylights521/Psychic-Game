# Hangman-Word-Guess-Game Vacay Addition

This word guess game is a vacation themed edition of the beloved childhood game hangman. Despite itâ€™s dark name (hangman?!), this is a fun game so grab your tropical drink of choice and play a round or two.

##How to play: 
Player hits any key to play and has up to 6 incorrect guesses per round. Only letters will actively play (no shift, backspace, etc.). The display will show a variety of information to the player, including the letters they have guessed correctly as well as incorrectly on the current round, how many remaining incorrect guesses are available for the round (again out of 6), as well as shows a running total of wins to losses. A results message appears in the following instances: when the player guesses the word (congrats and what the word was), and when the player runs out of turns (you lose).
